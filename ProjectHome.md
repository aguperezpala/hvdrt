A video-camara system for real time measurement of hydrodynamic parameters in a 2D wave channel is presented in this work. The process uses a low cost web cam of high resolution, which represents a no-intrusive method. Precision of measurement of wave height and period is compared to traditional instruments such as resistive sensors. The main objective was to obtain acceptable levels of errors for engineering purposes.  The estimated errors, from measurements are in the order of 0,1 cm when defining the wave height and 0,009 seconds to define the wave period.
A user friendly software was developed with a graphical interface to configure the system and process the signal measurements. It is a flexible program since it has the potential to increase the parameters used in the algorithms. The software was developed in a framework that will allow to create future applications (to measure other hydrodynamic or sedimentary variables for example) easily and faster, given either the opportunity to utilize the GPU as process unit.
